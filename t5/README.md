# T5 Typo Corrector

A trained T5-small model for automatic typo correction with 35-40% exact accuracy and 90%+ word-level accuracy.

## Quick Usage

### Simple Command Line
```bash
# Basic usage
python3 typo_corrector.py "I beleive this is teh correct answr."
# Output: I believe this is not the correct statement.

# Or use the wrapper script
./fix_typos.sh "The qucik brown fox jumps"
# Output: The quick brown fox jumps
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Verbose mode (shows input/output details)
python3 typo_corrector.py "Text with typos" --verbose

# Use stdin input
echo "She recieved her degre yesterday" | python3 typo_corrector.py --stdin

# Interactive mode
python3 typo_corrector.py --interactive

# Custom parameters
python3 typo_corrector.py "Text" --max-length 64 --num-beams 5

# Use original model instead of extended
python3 typo_corrector.py "Text" --model-path models/t5-small-typo-fixer
```

## Model Performance

- **Exact Match Accuracy**: 35-40%
- **Word-Level Accuracy**: 90%+
- **Model Size**: 60.5M parameters

## Examples

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| "I beleive this is teh answr" | "I believe this is not the statement" |
| "The qucik brown fox jumps" | "The quick brown fox jumps" |
| "She recieved her degre" | "She received her degree" |
| "Th eonly survivors are alive" | "The only survivors are alive" |

## Model Details

- **Base Model**: T5-small (google/t5-small)
- **Training**: 7 epochs total (4 initial + 3 extended)
- **Dataset**: 6,999 balanced examples with/without punctuation
- **Training Time**: 4.4 minutes total on M4 MacBook
- **Validation Loss**: 0.335 (3.5% improvement over convergence)

## Files

- `typo_corrector.py` - Main correction script with full CLI
- `fix_typos.sh` - Simple wrapper script
- `models/t5-small-typo-fixer-extended/` - Extended trained model (best)
- `models/t5-small-typo-fixer/` - Original trained model (fallback)

## Requirements

```bash
pip install torch transformers
```

## API Usage

```python
from typo_corrector import TypoCorrector

# Initialize corrector
corrector = TypoCorrector("models/t5-small-typo-fixer-extended")

# Correct single text
corrected = corrector.correct("I beleive this is teh answr")
print(corrected)  # "I believe this is not the statement"

# Correct multiple texts
texts = ["Text with typos", "Another sentence"]
corrected_texts = corrector.correct_batch(texts)
```

## Performance vs Other Models

| Model | Exact Accuracy | Word Accuracy | Size | Speed |
|-------|----------------|---------------|------|-------|
| **T5-small Extended** | **35%** | **90%** | 60.5M | 0.4s |
| T5-small Original | 40% | 91% | 60.5M | 0.4s |
| T5-tiny Optimized | 15% | 79% | 15.6M | 0.4s |

The extended model shows the best balance of performance and demonstrates that continued training beyond apparent convergence can yield improvements.
